Inspiration & Need:

My father has a pool in Florida and currently scoops out items on the surface by manually swooping a butterfly net across the pool. This is bad for his back, boring, and takes a long time to do a good job. Thus, there is a need to develop a controllable aquatic vehical to capture debris.

Goals:
1. To prove I can build a boat that floats on water
2. To prove I can communicate with the boat from a distance effectively
3. Incorporate forward thinking in iterating off of a built prototype.
