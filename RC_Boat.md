Inspiration & Need:
My father has a pool in Florida and currently scoops out items on the surface by manually swooping a butterfly net across the pool. This is bad for his back, boring, and takes a long time to do a good job. Thus, there is a need to develop a controllable aquatic vehical to capture debris.

3. Incorporate forward thinking in iterating off of a built prototype.
